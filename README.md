## Accurate and powerful survey website for Taiwan 

### INTRODUCTION

Since Google Map only provide LatLng and UTM format coordinate which are for worldwide but not for perticular country, user from Taiwan don't have the accurate survey data from google map. In order to solve this problem, we need to use a 2D coordinate system based on Taiwan's own requirement.

This website is based on my research *"A Study of the Optimal Scale Factor along the Central Meridian for the TWD97 Transverse Mercator Projection in 2Ëš Zones"*, which provide a batter 2D coordinate system and increase accuracy for survey data for Taiwan.

MapCADder also provide many useful functions for users.
- user can export google map image as png file.
- user can export the geometry object as Autocad DXF file.
- convert coordinate between latng, UTM, and TWD97 coordinate system.
