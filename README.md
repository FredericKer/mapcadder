A more accurate and powerful google map based survey website for Taiwan 

Since Google Map only provide LatLng and UTM format coordinate, and both of them are not the best soluation for Taiwan.

This website is base on my research "A Study of the Optimal Scale Factor along the Central Meridian for the TWD97 Transverse Mercator Projection in 2Ëš Zones", which provide a batter 2d coordinate system and increase accuracy for survey data for Taiwan.
